# Reviewed Beta infrastructure operations

This runbook describes the bounded source entry points delivered by
[AnyWear #104](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/104), retaining the
independent historical cutover evidence from [AnyWear #54](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/54).
The verified cutover assigns Infra the sole operational Beta deployment queue.
AnyWear-Service remains the application, migration, verification and immutable
artifact publisher. Account `650880818323` uses `ap-east-1` for the application
and `us-east-1` for Billing. The cutover preserved the observed
image/Client/Lambda/policy tuple and endpoints; ordinary source merges do not
choose a newer application.

The accepted IAM boundary is limited to the named legacy Beta role: its trust is
deny-only with zero inline or attached grants. The inherited Dev wildcard E2E
subject, `cdk-*` assume-role chain and CloudFormation execution role with
`AdministratorAccess` and no permissions boundary remain unchanged and outside
this runbook's #54 claim. Operational single-queue ownership is not account-wide
IAM exclusivity or Beta resource isolation.

## Issue #166: three Beta stacks

Beta is three stacks with disjoint lifetimes. `Base` (`AnyWearPlatformStack-beta`,
physical name retained) holds the VPC and its subnets plus each subnet's route
table and association, Aurora, S3, Cognito, ECR, SQS, SSM parameters and both
CloudFront distributions and is persistent. `Egress` (`AnyWearEgressStack-beta`)
holds only the NAT, EIP, the 0.0.0.0/0 default routes in the Base-owned private
route tables, and the S3 gateway endpoint, and is deleted on stop; it creates no
route table and no subnet route-table association (AWS allows one association per
subnet and Base owns it). `Runtime` (`AnyWearRuntimeStack-beta`, Infra-owned; it
replaced the old Workload identity) holds the ALB, ECS services/task definitions,
log groups and the cleanup operation and is deleted on stop.

There is no `environmentRunning` switch, no `BetaActive` output and no stopped
template. Run state is one fact: whether the Runtime stack exists. Stop deletes
Runtime then Egress; start recreates Egress then Runtime; `restore-release`
requires Runtime to exist ("start first"). A Base mutation still reads Runtime
terminal first (one writer), and a missing Runtime is the stopped state rather
than an inactive variant to maintain. The one-time Base/Runtime split migration
is Deployment-gated: see [beta-split-migration.md](beta-split-migration.md).

### Egress NAT/EIP replacement experiment

The Egress stack's NAT/EIP constructs are renamed `NatGatewayNext`/`NatEipNext`
(formerly `NatGateway`/`NatEip`) so the next `deploy-egress` gives the provider a
new source address. CloudFormation creates a new EIP/allocation and NAT, updates
both 0.0.0.0/0 routes to the new NAT, then deletes the old NAT and releases its
EIP. The `EgressNatGatewayId` and `EgressNatEipAllocationId` output logical
IDs/names stay unchanged; only their values change.

The current old physical IDs are `18.162.201.142` (EIP) and
`nat-0bf635c13de95e370` (NAT). Record the new EIP/allocation and NAT IDs from the
deploy readback; the source revision does not claim them before deployment. The
old pre-split address `16.163.218.252` was released and must not be reused. The
change is reversible, but a revert replaces again and allocates another EIP.
This experiment is source-only until the scheduler allocates the Beta writer; no
deploy is authorized by the source change.

### Drill precondition: pin the Egress NAT EIP

The recovery drill needs the provider to see the same source address across the
stop/start until the moment the experiment changes it. The working EIP is
`54.46.99.32` (`eipalloc-0a5198fb91b876949`). The Egress stack owns no EIP when
`deploy-egress` receives this allocation: the NAT and the
`EgressNatEipAllocationId` output use the provided value. Without the input the
stack creates a fresh EIP and retains it across deletion.

Drill flow:

1. Deploy the fix: the default Egress synthesis marks its EIP `Retain`, so this
   deploy installs the policy without replacing the current EIP.
2. Stop with `delete-egress`: the EIP `54.46.99.32`
   (`eipalloc-0a5198fb91b876949`) is retained; the operation's step log and the
   stack's own events name the allocation it kept.
3. Start with `deploy-egress` and
   `nat_eip_allocation_id=eipalloc-0a5198fb91b876949`: the stack creates no EIP
   and reuses the retained allocation, so the provider sees the same address.
4. Continue the remaining drill steps with that address.

Fallback: if the allocation is missing, run `deploy-egress` without
`nat_eip_allocation_id`; a new EIP is created and the provider probe must be
repeated. The input is accepted only for `deploy-egress` and must match
`eipalloc-[0-9a-f]+`; the retained allocation is recorded in the operation
context and the delete event.

## Step C: the release slice left this repository (historical, pre-#195)

> **Historical (before #195).** This section records the #158 step C decision. The
> ownership and deploy path it describes no longer exist: since #195 the release
> slice's CDK source, baselines and deploy chain are in this repository, and
> `deploy-runtime` / `stop-runtime` are its only mutation paths. The slice deploys
> through the existing `beta-infra-deploy-role` and the standard CDK bootstrap
> path, and no Foundation per-service role exists.

After #158 step C, Infra owned Foundation, the Beta Base stack, Egress and Billing
only. The Service release slice's CDK source and deploy chain lived in
AnyWear-Service. The only path that could deploy that stack was Service's release
chain, and that path needed the deferred Foundation deploy (the two Service deploy
roles from step A, plus the round-3 CLI-path grants to `beta-service-deploy-role`:
the `cdk-bootstrap/hnb659fds/version` parameter, the dedicated
`cdk-hnb659fds-assets-650880818323-ap-east-1` template object, and that bucket's
list and location reads; no `cdk-hnb659fds-*` role assumption) and Service's own
`ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION=true`. Until that
round no workload deploy might be attempted from anywhere, and no Infra entry might
re-add one. The committed `selection`/`stack_sources` contract, its double-write
window, the cross-repository native-asset verification and the vendored Service
parser were deleted; `deploy-platform` and `restore-release` take one reviewed
Service release identity (`service_release_tag` + `service_commit`), read the
sealed release and its tag ref over the REST API and download only the two Lambda
bundles and the runtime policy before any credential. Deployment records were v3
and contained no `selection`.

**Do not deploy the post-C Platform template while Service's slice still reads
`PublishOutput*` outputs.** CDK's weak cross-stack reference feature emits those
outputs into the stage base only while the slice is synthesized in the same app;
after C a Platform deploy no longer emits them. The issue #158 extension
publishes the ten additional SSM parameters (`cleanup_task_role_arn` only outside
`legacy`, plus verification/one-shot role ARNs, one-shot log-group name/ARN,
one-shot security-group id, cluster ARN, both DLQ URLs and `isolated_subnet_ids`)
that Service's step D converts the remaining reads to, so once C and D are both
deployed the Platform/Workload deploy order no longer matters. Until D lands,
schedule the Platform deploy after (or with) that change. Both matrices record
the final Platform template exactly: the Platform baselines were re-recorded
without the `PublishOutput*` outputs and with the new parameters, so the
comparison has no removal allowance.

The practical pinned recovery was [stop 37886520975](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-Infra/actions/runs/37886520975)
followed by [start 37887802281](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-Infra/actions/runs/37887802281),
using historical Infra producer `bafc3072ea6aee2d5193009c014cb1cf04b43848`
and coherent Service release `407218593`. Active `restore-release` and
automatic failure recovery remain unexercised. Historical release `406706155`
is preserved evidence only: its runtime-policy bytes are incoherent, so it is
not a selectable rollback input.

The final correctness qualification is [E2E run 37949887097](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-E2E/actions/runs/37949887097),
with correlated cleanup [Service run 37950914153](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-Service/actions/runs/37950914153)
and final admission closure [Infra run 37951949885](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-Infra/actions/runs/37951949885).
It preserves deployed Client `8320db0816b1c2d36e79a583160548744fd3d8c0` and
Service `ab211c8212444b735e614ef9a74f184d24744d6b` identities separately from
the newer executor heads. Public registration was intentionally skipped while
intake was closed; the observed provider timeout/retry case establishes
correctness only, not a latency SLA.

## Protected source and direct immutable inputs

The recorded setup has a `beta` environment restricted to main and an activation
gate `ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION=false`. The private plan returned 403 for branch
protection/rulesets; environment restriction is not repository branch protection.
Review exact source and inputs, coordinate one writer and freeze conflicting
Service/Client/E2E operations during #54 rollout. Enumerate Actions/local helpers,
CFN operations and ECS tasks; timeout or repository concurrency cannot prove peer
cessation. Ordinary Infra operations share `anywear-infra-runtime` with the
source-disabled Production workflow.

Environment configuration supplies account `650880818323`, region `ap-east-1`,
`INFRA_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::650880818323:role/beta-infra-deploy-role`,
`INFRA_RUNTIME_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::650880818323:role/beta-infra-runtime-role` and
the activation gate. `deploy-platform` and `restore-release` supply `service_release_tag` and
`service_commit`; every other operation rejects those inputs. Operation,
identity/retention and tester inputs are exposed only by the
relevant family in the [entry-point table](#entry-points). There is no
admission-mode or bound input: only the exact tester allowlist is written. No
operation writes a
deployment record: the run's conclusions, the `beta` Environment deployment, the
stack's own events, the release identity, the ECR digest and the live endpoints
are the audit facts (#207).

Before App credentials, source guards require the exact Infra Git origin/full
HEAD, main runtime workflow/account/region and clean tracked/untracked checkout.
All three release operations additionally carry the reviewed Service
release tag and source commit. Before AWS OIDC, a read-only Service token reads
the release identity over REST (the tag resolves to the reviewed commit,
`draft=false`, `immutable=true`, and every consumed asset is present, uploaded
and carries a `sha256` digest; extras such as the retired
legacy manifest are ignored) and downloads the operation's consumed set:
`deploy-platform`/`restore-release` take the two Lambda bundles and the runtime
policy (`pre-sign-up.zip`, `post-confirmation.zip`, `runtime-policy.json`), while
`deploy-runtime` takes only the sealed release's `service-schema.json` (#194). The
deploy job re-hashes each travelled byte once against those published digests
before it requests a session, then resolves the release tag, Service commit and the
ECR digest of the immutable `service-artifacts-<service_commit>` tag into the
deployed stack's parameters and the step log.
`deploy-runtime` additionally validates the travelled schema asset strictly before
the credential and again in the gate. There is no
selection schema, native attestation, release manifest, vendored parser or
publisher-run identity check on this path. See
[direct release identity](cutover-and-recovery.md#direct-release-identity).

Runtime uses the reviewed main workspace and `GITHUB_SHA`. A deploy proves the
synthesized template against the recorded `roles-added` identity, reads the
`Original` template and the five parameters back, and prints the deployed template
hash, the bake result and the minimum Client version floor in its step log; there
is no deployment record to write or read.
`APP_PRIVATE_KEY` stays in protected secrets and is used only by the three
operations that take a release. Publication ZIP/receipt/handshake ceremony stays
retired.

The former `stack-sources/<reviewed-name>.json` map (four rows: `stack_name`,
`region`, `source_repository`, `source_sha`) was deleted in #158 step C with the
selection contract. The configured stack set is now code
(`scripts/operation-stacks.mjs`): Foundation, the Beta stage base and Billing.
Actual authenticated CFN Original hashes remain independent evidence.

The historical committed Beta restart map (deleted with the selection contract)
retained
Foundation's accepted Infra bootstrap source
`88679b61630bc2344258cafb0d35b4d0b02e3a0d` and Billing's Service source
`58444ebe15a0ea08ca8f0c8aa91d0ba8a7bfb759`. Their historical operation and
preservation-overlay evidence remains independent of these four-key rows.
Platform and Workload use Infra `@executor` because `restore-release` reconciles both
stacks; the merge's actual reviewed main SHA becomes their producer only after the
operation succeeds.

Keep that reviewed main fixed through the protected deployment. The map is valid
for a later read-only `state` at the same SHA after both deployments; using it at a
newer main would wrongly relabel unchanged stacks. A read from newer main requires
a separately reviewed fixed map preserving the actual deployed Platform/Workload
SHAs. E2E v3 qualification consumes no Infra record and binds no Infra source: it
observes the platform itself (three stacks, the SSM inputs, both Lambdas, both
queues and the Client domain, before and after the suite). Deployment lineage is
the `beta` Environment deployment, the stack's own events and the release/ECR
identities. This source map alone is not runtime proof or authorization to deploy.

## Entry points

Infra exposes three entries and two manual dispatch surfaces. `check.yml` is
automatic; `runtime.yml` (`state`) and `mutate.yml` (the fourteen mutation
operations) are the only manual dispatch surfaces; `production.yml` is
`workflow_call`-only and not an entry. Both manual entries use exact reviewed
main, the `beta` environment and shared non-cancelling queue
`anywear-infra-runtime`. Their local composites split verification from
execution: [verify-operation](../../.github/actions/verify-operation/action.yml)
rejects cross-family operations, validates the reviewed Service release identity
for the three operations that take one, and reads that release and its tag ref over
REST and downloads only the operation's consumed files (three stage-base files, or
only `service-schema.json` for `deploy-runtime`) before App credentials;
[deploy-operation](../../.github/actions/deploy-operation/action.yml) proves the
travelled release bytes against the published digests and strictly loads the schema
asset or runtime policy, then obtains the operation-specific restricted STS session
and runs the operation. Only mutation requires
`ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION=true`; read-only `state` remains available when it is
closed. The environment restricts branches to main; no required-reviewer rule is
currently configured. Approval and writer allocation remain separate operational
gates.

| Workflow | Dispatch operation | Additional inputs / AWS boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [check.yml](../../.github/workflows/check.yml) | none (PR / push main) | Source checks only; no dispatch surface |
| [runtime.yml](../../.github/workflows/runtime.yml) | `state` | `state`: CFN and SSM read-only session, no tasks/PassRole/deploy role or schema assertion, works with the switch closed, publishes no artifact |
| [mutate.yml](../../.github/workflows/mutate.yml) | `deploy-foundation`, `deploy-billing`, `deploy-platform`, `deploy-egress`, `delete-egress`, `deploy-runtime`, `stop-runtime`, `restore-release`, `migrate`, `admission-status`, `add-testers`, `set-testers` | Chain: `preflight` (no credentials) → `verify` (read-only release token only; publishes the bytes as `service-release-bytes-<run_id>-<run_attempt>` and the published digests as its `release_assets` output) → `deploy` (the only job holding an AWS credential; `prove-release-bytes` runs first). No observation or record job. Explicit identity phase/retention accepted but only vary for `deploy-*`/`restore-release`; stack-specific deployment and selected verification tasks |
| [production.yml](../../.github/workflows/production.yml) | none (`workflow_call` only) | Future Production scaffold; source-disabled pre-AWS blocker; not an entry |

`deploy-platform`, `deploy-runtime` and `restore-release` require the reviewed
Service release tag
and source commit; every other operation rejects them.
Because one dispatch surface now hosts several operations, the per-operation
input scope is enforced in `scripts/runtime-operation.mjs` preflight rather than
by file presence: the tester payload belongs only to `add-testers`/`set-testers`,
there is no admission-mode or bound input, and identity
phase/retention protection may vary only for `deploy-*`/`restore-release` (every
other operation runs `retired`/`true`). The retained sizing profile is preserved
rather than set: `deploy-runtime` reads the live `BetaApiSizingProfile` and passes
it back unchanged, and no dispatch input carries a sizing value.
Non-deployment operations fixing `retired`/`true` source context does not change
CFN or prove observed IAM/retention state. Deployment and tester-write dispatches
require explicit authorization. Beta's paid compute and egress stop by deleting
the Runtime and Egress stacks, and start by recreating Egress then Runtime; no
operation selects a stopped Base template. Source delivery alone does not grant an
environment writer or establish runtime acceptance.

Every STS assumption includes an inline session restriction of at most 2048
characters. Task register/run/PassRole are limited to the operation's exact
families/roles; source guards also validate helper command/action. Direct writes
to ECR/SSM and unrelated tasks/deployments are rejected. Final qualification uses
a distinct session allowing only `artifact-verify` plus verification/execution
PassRole. Inherited credentials/profile/config are discarded. No role/grant/trust
or CDK resource is added. Existing OIDC trust binds Infra/environment, not workflow;
these reviewed source/session checks do not enforce workflow identity in IAM or
restrict the existing task roles' application privileges. Downstream CDK authority
remains unchanged. Unsupported reads still fail against existing role grants.
Every runtime CDK call explicitly selects `legacyRoleSource=external` for
this account. Foundation never constructs or adopts the external legacy roles.
The `cdk` source/simulation mode is used only by the independently labeled
Service baseline matrices and cannot substitute for the live Original comparison.

| Operation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `deploy-foundation` | Reconcile existing Foundation with reviewed identity phase; takes no Service release identity and no committed selection |
| `deploy-billing` | Reconcile existing Billing in `us-east-1` |
| `deploy-platform` | Deploy the persistent Base stack from one reviewed Service release identity (`service_release_tag` + `service_commit`): the verify job reads the release and its tag ref over REST with a read-only token, requires the two Lambda bundles and the runtime policy to be present, uploaded and digest-valid (extras such as the retired legacy manifest are ignored) and downloads only those three; the deploy job proves the travelled bytes against those published digests before any credential and resolves the release tag, Service commit and ECR image digest. A Base deploy requires the Runtime slice to be terminal when present (one writer) and reads its `ApiLoadBalancerDnsName` as the distribution origin. The Environment deployment, the stack's events and the step log are the deployment's record |
| `deploy-egress` / `delete-egress` | Create or delete only `AnyWearEgressStack-beta`, the disposable NAT/EIP/default-route/S3-endpoint edge. It imports the Base VPC, NAT-placement subnet and private route-table ids from the Base CloudFormation exports and creates only the 0.0.0.0/0 routes in those tables (no route table, no association). `delete-egress` refuses unless the Runtime stack is absent, so the stop order is Runtime then Egress. Include these inputs only for their own operation |
| `deploy-runtime` / `stop-runtime` | Deploy or delete only `AnyWearRuntimeStack-beta`, the disposable release slice. `deploy-runtime` takes the sealed Service release identity, downloads and strictly validates `service-schema.json`, resolves the ECR image digest, synthesises the Runtime stack from this repository and asserts the recorded `roles-added` hash before mutation, and — **before synthesis and any stack mutation** — runs the [schema-boundary gate](#schema-boundary-gate-and-applied-evidence): one bounded read-only `schema-journal` task from the existing `verify` family under the existing verification-task role compares the sealed release's declaration with the live applied Drizzle journal. A refusal (`asset-invalid`, `reader-unavailable`, `reader-failed`, `reader-evidence-unavailable`, `live-version-unproven`, `below-minimum-version`, `journal-entry-differs`, `applied-beyond-release`, `below-minimum-migration-count`) stops the run with the stack's `LastUpdatedTime`, template and parameters unchanged and no change set. A compatible boundary is logged, then the operation judges the change set: a converged set is deleted and nothing executes; when the live stack already carries the dispatched release, a reviewed `Add`/`Modify` delta with `Replacement: False` is admitted and executes, while any `Remove` or any replacement is deleted and refused with the named delta (issue #220); an absent stack stays Add-only, and a different release identity executes as before. It then bakes the unchanged 300-second six-signal gate under the read-only runtime session, reads `/health`, compares the deployed template hash and the five parameters with the requested deployment, and prints the bake result and the `/health` floor. `stop-runtime` deletes only that stack; an absent stack is the accepted no-op. Both require `identity_phase=roles-added` |
| `restore-release` | Reconcile only `AnyWearPlatformStack-beta`; require retired identity, protected retention and an existing terminal Runtime ("start first") before and after; never deploy, verify or recover the Runtime slice, and read no admission state |
| ~~`deploy-workload`~~ | Historical: removed in #158 step C, renamed to Runtime in #166; since #195 the slice is deployed by this repository's `deploy-runtime` operation, not by AnyWear-Service |
| `migrate` | Invoke Service's forward migration command in the selected immutable image; no admission precondition |
| `verify` | Invoke Service's verification command; verify the selected runtime without migrating |
| `state` | Print the Base/Runtime status, Runtime existence and the tester allowlist count and hash to the step log and summary; no DB/schema/policy qualification and no admission state |
| `admission-status` | Read the tester allowlist count and hash through the deployed Service lifecycle `status` command and compare them with one SSM read-back of `/anywear/beta/tester_allowlist`. Prints `{"operation":"admission-status","tester_count":N,"tester_allowlist_hash":"<64 hex>","matches":true}`; no mode field |
| `add-testers`, `set-testers` | Replace the exact normalized tester list through the deployed Service lifecycle `set-testers` command. There is no admission or lifecycle precondition: the operation is one SSM write, then one read-back compares the persisted list's count and hash with the Service status line. Prints the same count/hash proof for the list it persisted |

### Schema-boundary gate and applied evidence

`deploy-runtime` refuses before any mutation unless the live database is inside the
sealed release's declared range. The gate runs after the stage-contract read and
the parameter resolution and before template synthesis, so a refusal leaves the
Runtime stack's `LastUpdatedTime`, template and parameters unchanged and creates no
change set.

- **The release declaration.** `service-schema.json` (the `verify` job publishes it
  as `deploy-runtime`'s only travelled asset, and the deploy job's byte proof
  re-hashes and strictly validates it before any credential) states the release's
  ordered Drizzle journal, `current_version`, `minimum_version`,
  `minimum_migration_count` and one
  `{id, idx, created_at, sha256}` row per migration. An unknown `schema_version`,
  a changed member or an internal misalignment refuses as `asset-invalid` before
  any AWS call.
- **The live read.** One bounded, read-only `schema-journal` one-shot from the
  existing `verify` task family prints exactly one canonical-JSON
  `anywear_applied_schema` line (applied version or null, journal-table presence,
  at most 256 ordered `{id, hash, created_at, tag}` rows, local journal length).
  The gate reads the stopped task's CloudWatch stream with the reviewed bound (16
  pages x 1000 events, 4096 messages, five two-second attempts, two matching
  complete scans), proves the task/definition/log identity and command, and
  refuses `reader-evidence-unavailable` on malformed, ambiguous or changing
  evidence.
- **The reader rule.** The selected release image is read first. A non-zero exit
  is `reader-failed` with the exit code recorded and is never retried on another
  image. Exit 0 without a marker (a release image that predates the reader)
  triggers exactly one fallback read from the deployed image and records
  `reader.source=deployed-image`; if neither image reports the journal the run
  refuses `reader-unavailable`. At most two one-shot launches happen, at the
  existing Fargate size and under the existing one-shot timeout.
- **The comparison.** Every violation is collected: no recorded live version
  (`live-version-unproven`), an applied version below `minimum_version`
  (`below-minimum-version`), a differing `{sha256, created_at}` at a shared index
  (`journal-entry-differs`), an applied row the release does not contain
  (`applied-beyond-release` — the #156 defect: the old predicate compared only
  `min(selected, applied)` entries and reported an ahead database compatible),
  and a shortfall below `minimum_migration_count`
  (`below-minimum-migration-count`). A shortfall at or above the count boundary
  is compatible and records `pending_migrations`; an applied version ahead of the
  release with a contained journal is an observation (`version_ahead`), not a
  separate refusal. The comparison is positional against the release journal, so
  a duplicate or out-of-order live row cannot be absorbed.
- **What the run shows.** On success the deploy step logs one `schema-boundary`
  line: `result=compatible`, the asset digest (`asset.sha256`, bare 64 hex), the
  release identity (`{tag, service_commit}`), the reader identity
  (`{source, service_sha, image_digest}`), the compared `applied_rows` and the
  boundary body. On refusal the thrown `SchemaBoundaryError` names the reason, every
  violation with both sides and the reader/task identity, and it carries
  `evidence.applied_rows` and `evidence.reader(s)` for the log. The stack's
  unchanged `LastUpdatedTime`, template and parameters are the proof it was not
  touched. The admitted body the gate validates is:

  ```json
  {"result":"compatible",
   "asset":{"sha256":"<64 hex>","current_version":22,"minimum_version":20,
            "minimum_migration_count":24,"journal_length":26},
   "applied":{"schema_version":22,"journal_length":26},
   "comparison":{"checked_entries":26,"prefix_sha256":"<64 hex>","pending_migrations":0},
   "reader":{"source":"selected-image","service_sha":"<40 hex>","image_digest":"sha256:<64 hex>"}}
  ```

  `prefix_sha256` is `sha256(canonicalJson(appliedRows.slice(0, checked_entries)
  .map(({created_at, hash}) => ({created_at, sha256: hash}))))`; the gate recomputes
  it from the rows it compared, and it is part of the returned boundary body only.
- **The consequence.** A refused run has no change set, no mutation and no deployed
  identity; the failing step's message is the refusal. A database migrated by a
  newer image is no longer rollback-compatible: the journal comparison refuses it
  and a reviewed forward fix is required.

A dispatch uses explicit inputs, for example:

```sh
gh workflow run mutate.yml --repo git-malu/AnyWear-Infra --ref main \
  -f operation=deploy-platform \
  -f service_release_tag="$SERVICE_RELEASE_TAG" -f service_commit="$SERVICE_COMMIT"
```

For state-only observation dispatch `runtime.yml` with `operation=state`; it works
with the stage switch closed. For mutation select `mutate.yml` and its operation,
adding identity/retention only for `deploy-*`/`restore-release`, tester payload
only for `add-testers`/`set-testers`, and the release identity only for
`deploy-platform`/`restore-release`. There is no admission-mode input.
A deployment that changes a configured stack needs no separate observation
dispatch: the run's own conclusions, the `beta` Environment deployment and the
stack's CloudFormation events are the deployment's evidence. Read-only `state`
through `runtime.yml` remains the way to document live state outside a deployment
run, and it changes nothing. Initial role bootstrap uses the
[Foundation-only procedure](cutover-and-recovery.md#foundation-only-bootstrap),
because no sealed Service release is needed to create the artifact publisher role.

### Foundation service set (retired by #195)

The `infraServices` CDK context and the two per-service deployment roles it named
(`beta-<service>-deploy-role` and `beta-<service>-deploy-cfn-role`, with the
immutable OIDC subject derived from the descriptor) were retired by #195 with the
Service deploy chain. `bin/infra.ts` now rejects a stale `infraServices` context
explicitly before creating any resource, the synthesized Foundation contains no
per-service role, and `@git-malu/stage-contracts` no longer exports the role-naming
helpers. The Runtime stack deploys through the existing `beta-infra-deploy-role`
and the standard CDK bootstrap path; `deploy-runtime` is the operation. Issue
#199's separately authorized `deploy-foundation` removed the four retired
resources from the live Foundation, and
`test/fixtures/foundation-live-provenance.json` no longer records a pending
removal.

## Retained Beta sizing (retained on the Runtime stack)

Issue #95 adds one retained sizing parameter without changing lifecycle
authority. `BetaApiSizingProfile` defaults to `s1` (API CPU 512 / memory 1024
MiB); `s2-api` selects CPU 256 / memory 512 MiB together. The S2 profile remains
an unqualified candidate until same-image acceptance and recovery evidence are
recorded. Worker remains CPU 1024 / memory 2048 MiB, and API desired/minimum
counts stay 1/1.

`BetaApiSizingProfile` is a parameter of `AnyWearRuntimeStack-beta` and remains
on it while paid compute is stopped. `deploy-runtime` reads the live retained
value and passes it back unchanged, so an ordinary deployment preserves it; the
operation exposes no sizing input, and it fails closed on an unreviewed retained
value. A pre-parameter deployment means `s1`. Unknown retained values fail closed
in the state observer and in the deploy parameter resolver. The parameter starts
and stops nothing and grants no environment writer. State-only observation
reports the retained profile but cannot prove a running task size.

The second retained switch — the sizing-telemetry parameter and the container
environment entry it fed — was removed by #183 together with the Service sizing
observations that read it, so no sizing or telemetry input remains. The
`deploy-runtime` transition that dropped both from the live stack completed on
2026-10-23 (run 39929648413, a passed 600-second bake with 40 probes under the
then-current calibration), and its recorded identity accepted only the roles-added
template it deployed. Issue #220 recorded the next Runtime identity transition — the
age-alarm calibration — and it deployed in `mutate.yml` `deploy-runtime` run
39988090020, so the live check again accepts only the recorded roles-added identity:
the `ed4e99ee…` template the #183 transition deployed is retired as the predecessor,
and the deployed `Original` normalises to the new recorded roles-added identity. A
stop/start is never the way to drop a retained parameter: a stop deletes the Runtime
stack, and a start already deploys a template without it.

## Tester allowlist and status

The tester allowlist is the only admission input and the only tester operation
surface. Dispatch alone supplies `tester_emails` as a JSON string; normalization
happens before credentials, so the dispatch value is normalized before any AWS
session exists. `admission-status` requires the empty array `[]`; add/set use exact
normalized email addresses, at most 50 users and the bounded SSM payload size. An
empty payload says nothing about the current list.

A tester run writes no operation record and no payload-hash artifact. What an
operator reads is the run itself. A write is one SSM write through the deployed
Service lifecycle `set-testers` command — with no admission or lifecycle
precondition — followed by one read-back: the Service `status` line and the SSM
value must agree on `tester_count` and `tester_allowlist_hash`. `admission-status`
performs the same comparison without writing. The step log prints one JSON line per
operation — `{"operation":"admission-status","tester_count":N,"tester_allowlist_hash":"<64 hex>","matches":true}`
for a status read, and the same count/hash proof for a write — and no line carries a
tester address. On success the step summary also carries the closing
`Infra operation <operation>; source <sha>` line. No record, no `.sha256` companion
and no artifact is produced or published (#207).

### Registration contract

Cognito `PreSignUp` is the one admission decision, for every `triggerSource`. It
reads only `/anywear/beta/tester_allowlist` (one `ssm:GetParameter`, one attempt, a
2-second deadline inside a `PreSignUpLambda` timeout of 10 seconds) and admits
exactly a normalized member; a missing, malformed, oversized, unavailable or denied
read refuses registration with the same message and a distinct log reason. An
account that exists is never re-gated: the allowlist constrains registration only.
`PostConfirmation` provisions unconditionally and has no admission SSM grant, and
`migrate`, `restore-release` and `runtime.yml state` read no admission state. The
user-pool `custom:e2e_bootstrap` attribute stays in the pool schema (AWS cannot
delete it) but is inert: no reader, no writer and not part of the app client's read
attributes.

### Tester status contract

The deployed Service lifecycle `status` prints exactly one JSON status line:

```json
{"action":"status","tester_count":2,"tester_allowlist_hash":"<64 lowercase hex>", "...": "backlog fields"}
```

`tester_allowlist_hash` is `sha256(JSON.stringify(<normalized, sorted, unique,
lowercase emails from the SSM value>))`, lowercase hex. The Infra reader selects the
line by `action === "status"`, requires the integer `tester_count` (0–50) and the
64-hex hash, and rejects any line that looks like a status but is malformed. It
does not read, require or mention an admission mode or record. Optional backlog
fields are validated when present but are diagnostic evidence, not an admission
decision. The bounded-log read still proves the stopped task's exact definition and
CloudWatch stream with matching complete scans; missing, duplicate or malformed
status evidence fails.

After cutover, Service's `beta-testers` entry point retains application-data
`cleanup` only. Infra owns status/add/replace. `beta-service-data-role` can run
only the reviewed verification/tester-cleanup families and pass their exact task
roles; `beta-service-artifact-role` has ECR publication rights without data/runtime
rights. Cleanup uses the separate `beta-anywear-tester-cleanup-task` role exposed
as `CleanupTaskRoleArn`; it does not receive the lifecycle task's admission-parameter
permissions. E2E delegates application cleanup through the pinned Service cleanup
entry point in its scheduled window. Its qualification role passes only the
read-only verification/execution task roles and cannot schedule tester cleanup or
tester configuration directly. Migrate older direct recovery helpers
before retiring the old role; no shared-role fallback is allowed. Enumerate nested
cleanup jobs and ECS tasks before narrowing or retiring access.

The approved cleanup permissions include `ReceiveMessage`, `DeleteMessage` and
`ChangeMessageVisibility` on both exact DLQs. IAM limits AWS actions/resources;
it cannot filter individual DLQ message IDs, SQL statements or ECS container
commands. Exact cleanup is constrained by the trusted helper in the selected
immutable Service artifact, the reviewed exact payload and the coordinated writer allocation. Reading `DatabaseSecret` does not create a database principal with
read-only grants. Verification's read-only behavior comes from the reviewed
command and its read-only transaction, including the authenticated inspection's
`repeatable read read only` transaction; secret access alone does not enforce it.

Issue #86's fixed cleanup capability lives in Workload as the versioned
`beta-anywear-tester-cleanup` Standard state machine, with a 30-minute timeout.
`CleanupStateMachineVersionArn` is the execution input; the unversioned
`CleanupStateMachineArn` is for inventory. Its published definition binds both
complete ECS task-definition ARNs, their selected image, roles, private network
and commands. A latest task-family revision is never an execution input.
Each task supplies a distinct 64-character SHA-256 ECS client token derived
from the machine execution ARN and fixed verify/cleanup suffix. No general
state retry reruns cleanup after an uncertain outcome.
The envelope supplies schema version 1, string `operation_id`, `run_scope`,
`request_sha256`, `service_commit_sha`, `service_image_digest` and serialized
`cleanup_request`. Service identity must equal the deployed Workload parameters
before verification starts. The original envelope is serialized before either
task adds result data, then passed to Service's fixed
`dist/ops/beta-cleanup-operation.js` wrapper for complete request validation.

Both optimized ECS `.sync` results must identify the exact cluster and task
definition, `LastStatus=STOPPED`, exactly one `OneShot` container, `ExitCode=0`
and the selected image digest. Missing, nonzero, mismatched or ambiguous task
results fail; verification failure prevents cleanup. Successful machine output
is `anywear_beta_cleanup_tasks` schema version 1. It carries operation/hash/scope,
selected Service identity, cluster/log group, both actual task and definition
ARNs, stopped statuses, exit codes and fixed log-stream prefixes. It does not
assert a database commit from task completion alone.

Before Cognito deletion, E2E independently authenticates the exact immutable
machine version/input, stopped ECS tasks/definitions and fixed CloudWatch stream.
It requires one complete `ANYWEAR_BETA_CLEANUP_RESULT=` record from the selected
Service wrapper after cleanup returns, with matching operation/hash/scope and
Service identity plus `transaction_committed=true`. Duplicate, missing or
truncated proof rejects the cleanup result. E2E receives only the additional
fixed task-definition/cluster task reads and the two fixed log prefixes; it
cannot register or run cleanup tasks, pass their roles or change data directly.
Publishing this capability is source delivery only. A new selected Service
release containing the wrapper, separately authorized active-Beta deployment,
authenticated deployed version and E2E qualification remain separate gates.

The named machine, immutable versions and fixed task revisions have CloudFormation
`Retain` deletion and update-replacement policies. Retention preserves evidence;
it does not authorize invocation of a previous capability. Invocation and the
machine role's task-launch policy grant only the current exact version/revisions.
Before updating the cleanup capability, its roles/tasks or selected Service,
inventory matching executions, execution history and cluster tasks, then
reconcile every running, unknown or unresolved result before updating the cleanup
capability, its roles/tasks or selected Service. No such
operation may span a capability update: updating the shared machine role can
revoke the preceding version's exact task grants. If recovery must invoke an
older retained version after an update, first review an explicit bounded list of
its exact version/task ARNs and their compatibility; no wildcard, latest-family
fallback or retention-only claim supplies that authority. Retained resources
remain inventoried for separately authorized cleanup.

Immediately before every Platform or Workload CDK call, including recovery,
the runtime checks the exact synthesized cleanup output name and performs two
matching complete bounded execution/task inventory scans. Active, pending,
unknown, malformed, incomplete or changing inventories block deployment. The
cleanup task-family filters use the existing cluster-scoped ECS read permission;
IAM does not restrict that read to individual task families. The family executor
admits the exact cleanup machine/execution read ARNs only
for Platform/Workload deployment and recovery operation sessions.
Read-only state and final qualification sessions receive no Step Functions
permissions; neither can replace the cleanup capability or invoke cleanup.
Historical terminal failures require separate result reconciliation
instead of permanently blocking every future deployment. A terminal failure is
not proof of transaction rollback or successful cleanup recovery. First install
requires stable Workload output and Original template absence plus cleanup-family
task cessation and inspection of retained orphan machines outside the stack.

## Coherent release recovery

`restore-release` requires `identity_phase=retired` and
`retention_protection=true` source context. It reconciles only
`AnyWearPlatformStack-beta`, requires an existing terminal Runtime ("start first"),
and reads no admission state: the tester allowlist constrains registration only, so
neither `migrate` nor `restore-release` nor `runtime.yml state` has an admission
precondition. Status evidence comes from the authenticated stopped task's actual
definition and exact CloudWatch log stream, with bounded pagination and matching
complete scans; missing, malformed or duplicate status fails. No CFN, service
scaling, migration or drain is part of a tester operation.

For a source-only tester operation, the committed
historical runtime-only stack-source map (deleted with the selection contract) retained all four
recorded producers, including Platform/Workload `ada13617da0280ca9a7da0798577db286e714edc`
from [S1 release restore](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-Infra/actions/runs/37970047230)
(attempt `1`, deployment artifact `11635817118`). The earlier successful restart
and its recorded deployment evidence remain historical, not the current
map's Platform/Workload source.
Foundation remains Infra `88679b61630bc2344258cafb0d35b4d0b02e3a0d` and Billing
remains Service `58444ebe15a0ea08ca8f0c8aa91d0ba8a7bfb759`.
Its current executor can be newer without relabeling unchanged stack producers.
If actual producers change, review a new exact map before use. New recovery
operations (`restore-release`) reject
`@executor` on any untouched stack.

**Historical restore sequence (before #158 step C; the current single-stack
behavior is in the [operation table](#entry-points)).** `restore-release` had one
activation precondition: admission already closed. A
stable stack status is required for the CloudFormation mutation itself, not as an
activation requirement. It verifies the selected candidate image's raw
runtime-policy identity, migration journal and compatibility with the applied DB
before either CFN deployment. It then deploys selected Workload, verifies its four
parameters and stable interfaces, deploys selected Platform, and qualifies selected
health and verification in the same queue. The strict fulltuple observer runs only
after this coherent sequence. Workload/Platform source rows bind this executor;
Foundation/Billing retain their explicit historical producers. Review the exact
Platform component/resource diff and recovery selection before allocating runtime.
The operation never migrates, changes phase/retention, writes testers or opens
admission. It preserves observed membership and closed admission at every phase
boundary, and its postcondition is a terminal Base stack plus an existing
terminal Runtime stack after each deploy.

An old signed release alone does not establish a usable rollback image: a raw
policy-byte mismatch fails the existing candidate check even if canonical policy
and schema match. A reviewed current coherent release is also a recovery input.
The (now-removed) single-stack `deploy-workload` operation remained strict; when an
older selection had different Lambda bytes, its final fulltuple observer failed
until Platform matched. Do not weaken these checks or call that mixed state a
successful recovery. Any restore failure records its stage, observed CFN
parameters/activity, admission and task evidence, with
`requires-explicit-recovery`; those CFN parameter
readbacks are not actual running ECS identity proof. It never automatically
deploys the other stack, reverts or reopens admission. A final observation
failure still fails the job and records the preserved operation artifact as
`partial`: the mutation completed but its end state is unverified. Only a
separately reviewed recovery may proceed from the observed partial state.

## Evidence and operation recovery

A protected Beta operation is audited from facts the platform already keeps. There
is no operation record, no deployment record, no `.sha256` companion and no
`record` job (#207); the four controls below still refuse before they act, and a
failed or partial run still ends visibly failed.

**What to read, in order**

1. The Actions run: its trigger, actor, source SHA, the job list and each job and
   step conclusion. `preflight` and `verify` are green with no environment and no
   AWS identity; `deploy` is the only job that held a credential.
2. The `beta` Environment deployment attached to the run, which names the commit
   the run deployed.
3. CloudFormation's own stack events and current status for the stack the
   operation scoped (`AnyWearFoundationStack`, `AnyWearPlatformStack-beta`,
   `AnyWearBillingStack-beta`, `AnyWearEgressStack-beta` or
   `AnyWearRuntimeStack-beta`), plus the `Original` template's parameters
   (`ServiceCommitSha`, `ServiceImageDigest`, the one retained sizing profile and
   the two stage constants on the Runtime stack).
4. The Releases API: `service-artifacts-<service commit>` is immutable, its tag
   resolves to that commit, and each published asset carries its `sha256` digest.
   The deploy step log prints the per-asset digest comparison it performed.
5. ECR: the image digest under the `beta-anywear-service` tag
   `service-artifacts-<service commit>`.
6. The deployed endpoints: `/health` (`service_commit`, `image_digest`,
   `minimum_client_version`, `status`) and `/readyz`, which is the bake gate's
   probe path.

**The four controls and why they stay**

| Control | Where it lives | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment authorization and credential boundaries | `scripts/authorization-preflight.mjs`, `scripts/operation-boundaries.mjs`, `scripts/operation-stacks.mjs`, `scripts/one-writer.mjs` | A dispatch must not touch a stack, role, one-shot family or AWS action its operation was not reviewed for, and the job that may read the private Service release must never be the job that may change the account. |
| Schema boundary gate | `scripts/schema-gate.mjs`, `scripts/schema-asset.mjs` | A deployment must not replace a runtime whose database the release image cannot read; the refusal names the release's expectation and the database's state before CloudFormation changes anything. |
| 300-second six-signal bake | `scripts/bake-gate.mjs`; thresholds, alarm and signal names from `@git-malu/stage-contracts` | A green CloudFormation update is not evidence of a working runtime; a bake breach must leave the deployment unqualified and the run failed. |
| Pre-credential byte and identity check | `scripts/release-inputs.mjs` + `scripts/prove-release-bytes.mjs` | The bytes about to be deployed must be the bytes the reviewed release published, and that must be true before an AWS credential exists. |

**The deployed age alarms' calibration (issue #220)**

The bake and the deployed CloudWatch alarms state age limits, and since issue #220
they state the same limit from the same place. Both thresholds and the outbox
sentinel are computed from `DEPLOYMENT_GATE_THRESHOLDS` in
`@git-malu/stage-contracts` (`0.7.0`), the table the 300-second bake reads, so a
later gate recalibration reaches the deployed alarms on the next Runtime deploy.
No threshold has a stage branch: Beta and Production synthesize the same values.

| Deployed alarm | Threshold | Period × evaluationPeriods | Effective detection | Paired gate threshold | Relation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<stage>-anywear-vto-oldest-message` | 150 s (was 300 s) | 300 s × 2 | two consecutive five-minute SQS periods above 150 s: about 10 minutes plus SQS publication lag | `sqs_oldest_message_age.max_seconds = 150` | threshold equal; detection deliberately later |
| `<stage>-anywear-auto-tagging-oldest-message` | 150 s (was 300 s) | 300 s × 2 | same | same | threshold equal; detection deliberately later |
| `<stage>-anywear-outbox-oldest-age` | 150000 ms (was 300000 ms) | 60 s × 2 | about 1–2 minutes; immediately (subject to the two-period rule) when a non-empty backlog is reported without an age | `outbox_oldest_age.max_age_milliseconds = 150000` | threshold equal; detection inside the bake window |

**The 150001 ms sentinel.** The outbox alarm reads `AnyWear/Worker`
`OutboxOldestAgeMs`, and two metric filters on `/anywear/beta/worker` publish it. The
first extracts `$.outboxOldestAgeMs` and has no default: issue #220 removed its
`defaultValue: 0`, because AWS publishes a metric filter's default whenever the
pattern does not match, not only when a matched line's field is missing, so the 0
made a non-empty backlog with no age look healthy. The second filter matches
`msg = "Durable task outbox metrics" && outboxBacklog > 0 && (outboxOldestAgeMs IS
NULL || NOT EXISTS)` and publishes the static value `150001`. A metric reading
exactly `150001 ms` therefore means **the worker reported a non-empty backlog with
no age** — read that same metrics line's `outboxBacklog`; it is the first value above
`GreaterThanThreshold` 150000 and is computed as threshold + 1, so it cannot drift
from the alarm. Only a pattern match can emit it, so a healthy line, an idle worker
and an empty backlog with a null age publish nothing and stay OK under
`TreatMissingData: notBreaching`.

**Why SQS detection is deliberately later than the bake.** Amazon SQS publishes
`ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` every five minutes. A shorter alarm period would
evaluate mostly empty windows, and `TreatMissingData: notBreaching` would punch
holes in detection; `evaluationPeriods: 2` is the pre-existing anti-flap
calibration, and dropping it to 1 would page on a single five-minute statistic. The
bake is the **deployment-window** control: it refuses a stalled queue within one
300-second window. These three alarms are the **continuing surface** an operator
watches between deployments, and their roughly ten-minute SQS latency is that
surface's recorded property, not a defect.

**The one artifact a mutating run publishes**

`service-release-bytes-<run_id>-<run_attempt>`. Its only content is
`.service-artifacts/selected/` — the Service-published release bytes this operation
consumes (`pre-sign-up.zip`, `post-confirmation.zip`, `runtime-policy.json` for a
stage-base deploy; only `service-schema.json` for `deploy-runtime`). It is retained
**one day**, its upload fails with `if-no-files-found: error`, and it has exactly
one reader: the deploy job's `prove-release-bytes.mjs` step. It is a deploy input,
not evidence: no AnyWear-authored JSON, no schema, no producer identity, no
verdict, no operation name and no `.sha256`. The published digest set does not
travel as a file at all — it is the `verify` job's `release_assets` output (a
one-line `asset -> sha256:<hex>` map), and the deploy job fails closed when it is
absent, empty or a different asset set. The run's audit trail is the run, the
Environment deployment, CloudFormation, the Release and ECR identities and the
live endpoints.

**When an operation fails or is partial**

No step uses `continue-on-error`. A refusal before any mutation leaves a red run
and an untouched stack: the failing step's message names the boundary — the
operation is forbidden for this workflow; the release tag does not resolve to the
dispatched commit; the schema boundary expected version X and observed Y; the bake
failed on these signals.

A mutation that landed and then failed a later gate still ends with a non-success
run, and the failing step appends one line to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`:

```text
Infra operation <operation> already changed <stack> and did not complete: the run is failed and the change is unqualified. Follow the Beta runbook's decision procedure.
```

`runtime-operation.mjs` prints the same sentence to stderr. That line plus the
stack's own events is the whole "changed but unqualified" signal; nothing reports
the operation complete, and no record says otherwise.

The decision the operator owes, in order:

1. Read the failing step's message and the step summary line.
2. Read the scoped stack's status and last update time. A stack still in a
   non-terminal state is an in-flight mutation: do not start a second writer.
3. If the change landed and the gate refused, decide between a reviewed forward
   fix (re-dispatch the same operation with a corrected release) and a rollback
   through the same operation surface. Rollback never runs down migrations; a
   database migrated by a newer image needs a reviewed forward fix.
4. Re-dispatch as a new run/attempt. A retry is a new run with its own conclusions;
   it never retroactively makes the earlier run complete.
5. A failed run leaves no accepted record to chase: there is no missing-record
   repair step and no `partial` verdict to reconcile.

**Interrupted or orphaned tasks.** A still-running verification/helper task remains
registered for explicit recovery. Inspect it and its owner before cleanup; expiry or
task-runner failure is not task cessation. Evidence for that inspection is the ECS
task/definition and CloudWatch logs, not a record.

**Historical exception.** AnyWear-E2E's
[`scripts/beta-cleanup-diagnostic.mjs`](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear-E2E/blob/main/scripts/beta-cleanup-diagnostic.mjs)
replays one pinned historical run's artifacts (Infra run `38899879395`, artifacts
`infra-deployment-38899879395-1` and `infra-operation-38899879395-1`). It reads no
new run, it is frozen, and it is the single labelled exception to this retirement.
Its pinned artifacts expire 2027-01-14, after which that diagnostic refuses at its
artifact-metadata check.

## Admission-mode migration and rollout (historical, pre-#158 step C)

**Issue #213 removed the admission mode entirely** — the parameter, the
`open-admission`/`close-admission` operations, the lifecycle `suspend`/`resume`
actions and the `migrate` fence below no longer exist. The steps below are the
recorded pre-C procedure. The `selection` inputs and the
`deploy-workload` operation they dispatch were deleted in #158 step C and cannot be
run from this revision; the Workload slice was then deployed only by
AnyWear-Service's release chain, and Runtime is now deployed by Infra's
`deploy-runtime`. The sequence is retained as evidence, not as operating
instructions.

The rename from the two boolean parameters to one mode record is expand → prove →
contract, and it spans three releases because the writable surface moves with the
Service image:

0. **With the previous Infra revision**, dispatch its admission-status operation
   (named `tester-status` there) and require the effective decision closed; record
   the observed mode and tester list. That recorded tuple is the pre-state
   the later equality proof compares against. Dispatch it with the deployed tuple's
   selection, `selections/beta-cleanup-150-148-5d16543.json` (Service `5d16543`,
   release `415612529`, schema 19).
1. **Platform deploy**: create `/anywear/beta/admission_mode` at
   `{"mode":"closed"}`, deploy the new Lambda readers and their exact
   `ssm:GetParameter`/`ssm:GetParameters` grant, and — when the additive and
   removal halves are dispatched from separate reviewed revisions — keep the two
   old parameters and their grants in place. The Platform stack owns the
   parameters, the grants and the two trigger readers; no admission operation can
   create them, and the old Workload image can only write the old parameters.
   Dispatch it with the same deployed-image selection;
   `deploy-platform` must retain the observed running image.
2. **`migrate`**: the forward-migration fence is satisfied by the
   CloudFormation-created `closed` value and by step 0's recorded tuple. The fence
   refuses open admission and every value that cannot *prove* closure, including a
   single throttled read. The Service migration `0021` adds the mode column with
   default `closed` and *then* added a check constraint requiring `testers` to carry
   a bound and `closed` to carry none — the constraint this batch's Service
   migration drops again — so migrating a database that still held a live window
   failed the constraint **before** the rename committed, leaving the old
   schema intact. That is why the documented `close-admission` predecessor is not
   a formality: it is what makes the migration apply, and a failed attempt is a
   fail-closed refusal rather than a half-migrated schema.

   **This dispatch is mandatory, not a formality.** Beta is deployed at Service
   `5d16543` with applied schema **19**, and the new image requires **20**.
   `deploy-workload` refuses an image the applied schema cannot support, so
   skipping this step does not partially roll Beta: it produces an `incompatible
   applied schema` refusal at step 3. The migration is a separate dispatch an
   operator must run, and step 3 is possible only after it applies.

   **Dispatch this step with a canonical selection for the schema-20 Service
   release**, not the deployed tuple's selection. The operation overwrites the
   observed revision's digest and commit with the selector's before it registers
   the one-shot, so this step legitimately runs the *new* image's migration while
   the old image is still deployed, and the step log attributes the migrate
   one-shot (task ARN, `service_sha`, `image_digest`) to the new image.
   Report that identity, not the still-deployed old one.

   **A failed conclusion is not the evidence.** Issue
   [#157](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/157) records that `migrate`
   applies its mutation and then fails its own post-condition *because the workload
   has not been deployed yet*, so a migration that applied cleanly is recorded as a
   failed run. Read the migrate one-shot's own log stream, not the run conclusion:
   `AnyWear-Service/src/migrate.ts` ends with
   `logger.info({ schemaVersion: CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION }, 'Database migrations completed')`,
   so a completed migration emits one JSON line with
   `"msg":"Database migrations completed"` and `schemaVersion` — **20** for this
   change, which also proves which revision ran it.
   - **Applied but reported failed:** that log line is present with
     `schemaVersion: 20`, and the applied journal contains `0021`–`0023`. Treat the
     migration as applied and continue to step 3; do not re-run it to "fix" the
     failed conclusion.
   - **Did not apply:** no such log line; the run failed before migration
     completion. Do not proceed to the workload deploy.
   This reading is a **dependency on #157** and must be removed when that issue
   lands, so the workaround does not become folklore.
3. **`deploy-workload`**: roll out the new API/worker image, which reads and writes
   the mode record and queries the renamed admission table. Dispatch it with the
   same schema-20 selection; `deploy-workload` refuses an image the applied schema
   cannot support.
4. **`admission-status`**: read the new surface back and compare it with step 0's
   tuple. Both must be closed, and the record's `effective_matches` must be true;
   that comparison — not a diff of history — is the old/new equality proof.
   Dispatch it with the same schema-20 selection, which now matches the deployed
   image.
5. **Platform deploy**: delete the two old parameters **and** their IAM grants in
   the **same** deploy, never split. `PutParameter` with overwrite can recreate a
   deleted parameter, so resources without their grants are not a cut-off; the
   grant removal is what makes a still-deployed old revision incapable of
   resurrecting either name. The proof that deletion stuck is both old names
   returning `ParameterNotFound` **and** the deployed lifecycle role policy no
   longer listing them. From that point every image below the new revision is
   incapable of admission: it reads deleted parameters and queries a renamed
   table. Dispatch it with the same schema-20 selection; the removal deploy
   retains the deployed new image.

**Step 3 needs a selection this revision does not contain.** Beta is deployed at
Service `5d16543` (release `415612529`, schema 19), and every committed
`selections/*.json` in this revision tops out at that revision: none of them
selects the schema-20 Service release the new image belongs to. Steps 0 and 1 use
`selections/beta-cleanup-150-148-5d16543.json`; steps 2–5 need the canonical
selection for the schema-20 release, which must be added to `selections/` (with its
raw hash) before step 2 is dispatched. An operator who dispatches step 3 with a
schema-19 selection gets the `incompatible applied schema` refusal from the
pre-deploy compatibility check, not a partial rollout.

This revision's Platform source declares only the mode record, so a Platform deploy
from it performs steps 1 and 5 in one CloudFormation update. Accept that collapse,
and know exactly what it forbids and what it costs.

**The collision to forbid** is deleting the parameters while the *old Lambda
readers* are still deployed — that would leave registrations reading a missing
record — and splitting step 5's resource deletion from its grant deletion.
Deleting the old parameters before the new *workload* image runs is what this
revision does, and it is safe only because steps 0 and 2 already guarantee closure:
step 0 recorded the environment closed, the new record was created
`{"mode":"closed"}`, and the then-current migration constraint refused a live
window. Nothing is left open by the collapse.

**The cost is a maintenance window.** Between that Platform deploy and
`deploy-workload`, no admission operation can run: they require the selected
revision to equal the deployed image, which is still the old one. Admission is
nevertheless closed throughout, for the reasons above, so nothing is left open —
but the environment cannot be re-closed or observed through a reviewed operation
until the rollout lands. Dispatch the Platform deploy, `migrate` and `deploy-workload`
back to back, and treat the gap as a maintenance window rather than a normal
operating state.

**The alternative, and its cost.** If that window is unacceptable, cut the additive
half as an intermediate reviewed Infra revision that declares
`/anywear/beta/admission_mode` **and keeps** the two old parameters and both grant
sets, with the removal arriving in a later Platform deploy. That gives the old
readers a working record across the gap at the price of an extra revision to
maintain and an extra Platform deploy to authorise, which is why this issue
documents the collapse instead of building it.

**The `migrate` → `deploy-workload` gap is an error state, not a closed one.** The
old image queries the renamed table and fails with a missing-relation error, so no
task is admitted but nothing reports "closed", and a sign-up can pass the
SSM-backed Cognito edge and then dead-end at provisioning. Step 0 is what keeps
that gap fail-closed: it guarantees the old mirror read closed before the change,
and the new mode record was born closed. An open requested inside the gap fails
closed — `open-admission` refuses because the database status does not prove an
effective closed decision — and recovery is roll-forward, because `deploy-workload`
already refuses an image the
applied schema cannot support, so the pair cannot be reversed by accident.

**The standalone `migrate` fence (historical; removed by #213).** The fence then
read `/anywear/beta/admission_mode` and answered `closed`, `open` or `unproven`;
only `closed` was accepted. #213 deleted the parameter and the fence together, so
the current `migrate` operation reads no admission state and cannot refuse on one.
